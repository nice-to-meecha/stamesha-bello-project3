- What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
    - Uploading images presented a decent challenge. I first found a tutorial
      to process files with busboy-connect, but the image quality was not consistent,
      with a number of pictures being blurry or only fractionally visible. With
      that middleware, there were maybe two or three times when images seemed to be
      uploaded properly. I tried looking into it but was not able to identify the
      problem in a reasonable amount of time. (Due to the inconsistencies, I now
      wonder if it was an asynchronous issue...) For the sake of time, I decided
      to try another package -- multer -- which works quite nicely.

    - I thought that, with the "Create Entry" button in the Navbar, simply linking to
      an existing CreateStatusUpdate component (on the home or user page) would make for
      the best user experience. However, I found that more difficult than expected.
      My original implementation, using the navigator (produced by useNavigate()),
      would only scroll and focus on the text box -- at most -- twice. If on a different
      page, it would navigate to the appropriate page and focus on the text area.
      From there, if selected again, it would do the same once more but no more after
      that. I tried updating a global variable in the Navbar, which was being "watched"
      in the ModifyStatusUpdate component (via useEffect()), but that wasn't working
      either, for some reason! I eventually found out that that there's a separate package
      for links with hashes, "react-router-hash-link", which performs all of this
      activity automatically, so I switched to using that.
        - It seems that the "Create Entry" button was removed from the project description
          rather recently, so my troubles seem to have been in vain. I will leave the
          button as is, as a memento of my struggles.

- Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make?
    - I would most certainly add more visual appeal to the site; it's rather bland and
      unexciting, at the moment. Ideally, I would add a splash page and an assortment of
      animations.
    - Additionally, for a more user-specific experience, I would add the ability to
      follow other users, as well as related functionality to retrieve StatusUpdates
      based on those followed.
    - I would store and retrieve StatusUpdates with userId -- rather than username --
      so that even if someone's username changes, their status updates will still
      be available and attributed to them

- What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
    - I assumed usernames would not contain characters that could make navigation
      difficult, when viewing UserPages.
    - I assumed users wouldn't upload an image that's too large for my current
      implementation to handle.
    - I also assumed that TA's would dig too deeply into error handling. ðŸ˜…

- How long did this assignment take to complete?
    - I should've timed myself, but I did not. It's honestly hard to say; I wanted
      to work on this much longer than I did, but I don't even know how much time
      I managed to devote to this. Maybe 50-70 hours..?

- Bonus Points Attempted
    - Password Encryption (2 pts)
        - The password is encrypted enroute to the database and is decrypted
          after being retrieved, in user.js.
    - Image Status Updates
        - Images are saved within the /public directory on the server running the
          backend and are then served, according to the imageUrl saved with
          relevant StatusUpdates.
    - Search for Users (5 pts)
        - The Navbar retains a searchbar, with which users can be searched,
          based on username. This will produce a list of UserLinks, which will
          link to the UserPage of the selected user.
