Fake Twitter... or is it?

Write-up
    If I had more time:
        - I would sdd a splash page and more animations
        - Add the ability to follow people
        - I would add the functionality to retrieve StatusUpdates based on specific
          users, so that you would only see posts from who you follow.
        - I would store and retrieve StatusUpdates with userId -- rather than username --
          so that even if someone's username changes, their status updates will still
          be available and attributed to them
